# satisfactionsurvey
A Satisfaction Survey implemented in PHP

Initially is small because of my basic needs, but I structured in a way that will be easy to scale

## Requirements
1. Apache
2. PHP 7.x
3. PHP Modules PDO and PDO_PSQL
4. PostgreSQL 9.x

Very simple usage: You have the schema to mount your database, after that, it is ready to use.
If you put the ?view=1 in the index link, you'll see the admin area. Soon I will implement some kind of
login to the admin area and a better way to access there without remember the view get stuff
